### Technologies

This project will only need to implament bare JS and the Canvas, potentially React to help expediate the process of rendering explinations and controls.

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Basic Render and view

**Objective:** Build the basic page with it's maze rendering method for any level of mid-generated or solved maze

- [ ] Initialize a static HTML page
- [ ] Generate a basic data structure to for the maze
- [ ] Write algorithms to ease maze manipulation
- [ ] Build canvas rendering for said maze

### Phase 2: Basic Generation Algo

**Objective:** Write the basic genration algorithm (Depth First)

- [ ] Write the algorithim and render the final product
- [ ] Implament Time controls and rendering in succession
- [ ] Write / Display algorithm discription

### Phase 3: Basic Solution Algo

**Objective:** Write the basic solution algorithms (Breadth First)

- [ ] Write the algorithim and render the final product
- [ ] Implament Time controls and rendering in succession
- [ ] Write / Display algorithm discription

### Phase 4 and Beyond: Repeat Generation / Solution with extra Algorithms
